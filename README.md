## 📘 Project Summary
This project integrates aviation data from the United States (BTS Flight Dataset) and Europe (EUROCONTROL Flight Statistics) to build a global-level understanding of flight operations and delay patterns.

### Milestone 1 (M1):  
- Exploratory analysis of U.S. flight delays  
- Exploration of European flight movement statistics  
- Comparison between regions  
- Trend analysis and visualization  

### Milestone 2 (M2):  
- ETL pipeline design  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Schema harmonization  
- Dataset integration into a unified global dataset
